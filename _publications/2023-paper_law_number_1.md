title: "Multi-layered Annotation of Conversation-like Narratives in German"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/01/07/2023-paper_law_number_1
excerpt: 'This work presents two corpora based on excerpts from two novels with an informal narration style in German. We performed fine-grained multi-layer annotations of animate referents, assigning local and global prominence-lending features to the annotated referring expressions. In addition, our corpora include annotations of intra-sentential segments, which can serve as a more reliable unit of length measurement. Furthermore, we present two exemplary studies demonstrating how to use these corpora.'

This work presents two corpora based on excerpts from two novels with an informal narration style in German. We performed fine-grained multi-layer annotations of animate referents, assigning local and global prominence-lending features to the annotated referring expressions. In addition, our corpora include annotations of intra-sentential segments, which can serve as a more reliable unit of length measurement. Furthermore, we present two exemplary studies demonstrating how to use these corpora.
