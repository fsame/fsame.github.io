I hold an M.A. degree in Linguistics from Utrecht University. I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Cologne, working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nikolaus Himmelmann (Cologne University) and Prof. Dr. Kees van Deemter (Utrecht University). I work on the generation of referring expressions, with a specific focus on discourse measures and contextual factors. I'm interested in building a bridge between linguistic theories of discourse and computational methods.
