I am a **Data Scientist** at **Trivago N.V.** in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, where I work on building rule-based, ML, and LLM models for various tasks including matching, deduplication, and data enrichment. I develop and optimize BigQuery SQL and Python pipelines at scale, perform exploratory data analysis, and collaborate with backend engineers to productionize scalable models.

Previously, I completed my **Ph.D. in Linguistics** at the **University of Cologne** (2017-2022), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nikolaus P. Himmelmann and Prof. Dr. Kees van Deemter. My research focused on **Referring Expression Generation in Context**, combining linguistic and computational approaches to understand how humans choose referring expressions in discourse.

My academic background includes a **Research Master's Programme in Linguistics** from **Utrecht University** (2012-2014), where I worked on the vector-based semantics of distal PP modification under Prof. Dr. Yoad Winter and Dr. Choonkyu Lee.

I am passionate about **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, and building bridges between linguistic theories and computational methods. My research interests span from classical machine learning approaches to transformer-based large language models, with a particular focus on human evaluation methodologies and reliable NLG assessment.
