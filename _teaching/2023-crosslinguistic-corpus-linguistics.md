**Co-taught with Maria Bardají i Farré**

This master-level course introduces students to the principles and methods of crosslinguistic corpus linguistics, exploring how corpus-based approaches can be applied to study linguistic phenomena across different languages.

## Course Overview

The course covers theoretical foundations and practical applications of corpus linguistics in a crosslinguistic context, providing students with hands-on experience in corpus compilation, annotation, and analysis across multiple languages. Students engage with both theoretical readings and practical software tools including ELAN, INCEpTION, and R.
