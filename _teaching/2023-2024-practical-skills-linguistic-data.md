**Academic Year:** 2023-2024  

This course equips students with essential skills and techniques to effectively handle linguistic data throughout the data lifecycle. Through hands-on training, students learn essential skills in preprocessing, working with data, and postprocessing using R.

## Course Overview

The curriculum covers diverse preprocessing methods for cleaning and preparing primarily text-based linguistic data, enabling further annotation and analysis. Additionally, students explore techniques for data annotation, metadata management, and representation of linguistic information. The course also delves into the postprocessing phase, where students learn how to analyze and visualize linguistic data.

**No prior programming experience required** - this course is accessible to all students interested in managing and analyzing linguistic data.
